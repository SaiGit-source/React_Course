DeepDive:

Technically we dont need JSX to build React projects

<div id="content">
	<p>Hello World!</p>
</div>

||

React.createElement(
'div'
{ id: 'content' },
React.createElement(
	'p',
	null,
	'Hello World'
	)
);

createElement is a non-JSX approach


we cannot return two values in both function and JSX element

from the previous project, we extend in deep dive

the issue was the header was reloaded whenever we clicked the TabButtons and thats not right
so we split the tabSection into another component called 'Examples'. Splitting into multiple components solved this issue

now clicking on the TabButtons doesn't change the header text: "Crucial React concepts you will need for almost any app you are going to build!"
the reason it doesn't changes because only this 'Examples' component is reloaded when state changes and not the 'App' component (along with 'Header' component), unlike earlier
