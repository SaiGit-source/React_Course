What's React?
It's a library for web and native user interfaces

Library for building user interfaces

JavaScript library for building user interfaces

why would you use it?
Smoother transition, lightweight, easy-quick page loading,  -> because it uses JavaScript in the browser to update page and User interface without reloading the page.

JavaScript gets the movies data in the background without reloading or leaving the page then updates the screen with the movies data leading to smoother transition between pages

Why not just JavaScript?
writing complex JavaScript code quickly becomes cumbersome
complex JavaScript code quickly becomes error-prone
complex JavaScript code often is hard to maintain or edit
React offers a simpler mental model and easier way of building complex web user interfaces and applications


Lets say we have index.html file (contains HTML elements for displaying the majority of the page) and index.js (responsible for getting hold of these buttons, for adding click listeners responsible for getting hold of the buttons, click listeners to the buttons), App.js will have all HTML code for React as opposed to vanilla JavaScript code (index.html). App.js defines different states for the components like btn has a state "active"

React = Declarative UI programming

with React, you define the target UI state(s) - not the steps to get there - React will figure out & perform the necessary steps. we define only target conditions or states when they should change

Vanilla JS code: we are writing imperative JS code not declarative. difficult to update code, say to add a new button, complex

Updated Page: added a new button

To start a new project: type react.new : https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-new?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js&utm_source=dotnew  it will open a new React project automatically (in-browser development environment)

 
package.json -> it has dependencies like react and react-dom -> it is used by NodeJS for managing dependencies in the project 

Website we are building typically have different states: if we have a dynamic website -> a website where things change after it was initially loaded.. even in the Blog App, we want to change Text after the website is rendered. that means the website has different states -> changing texts

useEffect() is for preventing infinite loops of sending HTTP requests when page reloads. it will only reload once when something outside of useEffect function changes

React builds a single page application (only one HTML file) -> Routing -> listening to URL changes while App is running, evaluating URL when first loading, loading different components for different paths that are encoded in the URL. npm install react-router-dom. it will enable to load different components for different URL paths

Outlet -> we need it to render nested route contents

Data fetching via loader: () => {} whenever the router is being called, this loader function gets executed. works well for slow backend. better user experience

Submitting data with action() -> replace form with Form, then when the form is submitted, the function associated with action will get automatically executed

we can say return redirect('/'); to redirect to a different path/route

Dynamic route {path: '/:id'} with a dynamic path parameter id
