Advanced DOM access & value management
it can help to solve certain problems that are almost impossible to solve

Accessing DOM elements with Refs

Managing values with Refs (when it shouldn't be state)

Exposing API functions from components

Detaching DOM rendering from JSX structure with Portals

Demo project is kind of a game where website vsitors can start different timer challenges with a goal of estimating when time is up and stopping timer early enough before it expires

it can be built with Refs and Portals, components, states etc

Note: whenever Ref changes, component function doesn't re-execute unlike the State changes

State: causes component to be re-evaluated or re-executed when changed, Should be used for values that are directly reflected in the UI, Should not be used for "behind the scenes" values that have no direct UI impact
Refs: Do not cause component re-evaluation when changed, can be used to gain direct DOM element access (-> great for reading values or accessing certain browser APIs),
