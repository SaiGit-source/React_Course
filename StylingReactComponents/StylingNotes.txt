Styling:

Styling with vanilla CSS -> Advantage: CSS code is decoupled from JSX code, we can write our own CSS, CSS code can be written by another developer in parallel
Disadvantage: You need to know CSS as well, CSS rules are not scoped to components therefore we could have Styling conflicts 

Inline Styles: Advantages: Quick & easy to add to JSX, Styles only affect the element to which you add them, Dynamic conditional styling is simple. Disadvantage: you need to know CSS, You need to style every element individually, No separation between JSX and CSS. All CSS code lives in JSX file

Scoping styles with CSS modules
CSS-in-JS styling with "Styled components"
Styling with Tailwind CSS
Static and Dynamic (conditional) styling
