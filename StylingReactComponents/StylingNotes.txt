Styling:

Styling with vanilla CSS -> Advantage: CSS code is decoupled from JSX code, we can write our own CSS, CSS code can be written by another developer in parallel
Disadvantage: You need to know CSS as well, CSS rules are not scoped to components therefore we could have Styling conflicts 

Scoping styles with CSS modules
CSS-in-JS styling with "Styled components"
Styling with Tailwind CSS
Static and Dynamic (conditional) styling
